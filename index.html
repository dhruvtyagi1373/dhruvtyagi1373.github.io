							<h2>Dhruv Tyagi Portfolio</h2>
							<p>"Hello, my name is Dhruv Tyagi, and I recently graduated with a degree in Computer Science from Aryabhatta College, University of Delhi. I have a strong foundation in data analysis, machine learning, statistical modeling, Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing which I developed through both my coursework and hands-on projects. I am proficient in programming language like Python and have experience with data visualization tools such as PowerBI. 
								I am passionate about using data to uncover insights and solve complex problems, and I am excited to bring my skills and enthusiasm to a data science role." <a href="http://html5up.net"></a></p>

										<h2 class="major">Credit Card Fault Detection</h2>
										<p>In this project, I developed a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions, leveraging various data preprocessing and machine learning techniques to ensure high accuracy and efficiency.
											The project successfully demonstrated the application of machine learning techniques in detecting credit card fraud. By addressing data imbalance, employing robust preprocessing steps, and utilizing advanced machine learning models, we achieved a highly effective fraud detection system that can be leveraged by financial institutions to enhance security and protect against fraudulent activities.

										<h2 class="major">Sign Language Detection</h2>
										<p>In this project, we developed a computer vision system to recognize and interpret sign language gestures, enabling effective communication for individuals with hearing or speech impairments.
											The project successfully demonstrated the application of computer vision techniques in recognizing sign language gestures. By integrating CNNs and RNNs, we developed a robust system capable of interpreting a wide range of gestures in real-time. This technology has significant potential to enhance communication accessibility and support inclusivity for the hearing-impaired community.

										<h2 class="major">Text Summarization using NLP</h2>
										<p>In this project, we developed a text summarization system using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, leveraging transformers from the Hugging Face library to generate concise and coherent summaries of lengthy documents.
											The project successfully demonstrated the application of transformer-based models for text summarization. By fine-tuning state-of-the-art model like google/pegasus-cnn_dailymail, we achieved high-quality summaries that capture the core information from lengthy documents. This summarization system has significant potential for applications in news aggregation, academic research, and content management, enhancing information accessibility and comprehension.
